## 💡 Why This Fix Works

**Problem:** `FileSystem.EncodingType.Base64` was trying to access a constant that doesn't exist in newer versions of expo-file-system.

**Solution:** Use string literal `'base64'` directly, which is the standard way to specify encoding in the API.

**This approach:**
- ✅ Works with all versions of expo-file-system
- ✅ More compatible
- ✅ Recommended by Expo docs

---

## ✅ Summary

**What Changed:**
- Fixed encoding type in `imageUpload.ts`
- Changed `FileSystem.EncodingType.Base64` → `'base64'`

**What You Need to Do:**
1. Reinstall dependencies (`npm install`)
2. Restart app (`npx expo start --clear`)
3. Delete old failed shop
4. Re-register with photos

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Images upload to Supabase Storage
- ✅ Display in Super Admin Dashboard
- ✅ No more "Base64 of undefined" errors
