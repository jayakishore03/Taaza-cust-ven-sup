- Returns success/error response

### 3. Super Admin Button
**File:** `meat super admin/src/pages/Partners.tsx`

- **Button Location:** Partner details panel, in the Approval Actions section
- **Visibility:** Only shown for approved shops (`is_approved: true`)
- **Button Label:** "Send Welcome Email" with mail icon
- **Loading State:** Shows spinner while sending

## Configuration

### Development Mode
In development, the email content is logged to the console:
```javascript
console.log('📧 EMAIL CONTENT:');
console.log('Subject: 🎉 Welcome to Taaza - Your Shop is Now Live!');
console.log('HTML Preview:');
console.log(emailHTML);
```

### Production Mode
For production, you need to configure an email service:

#### Option 1: Resend (Recommended)
1. Sign up at [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Get API key
3. Add to `.env`:
   ```
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```
4. Uncomment the Resend code in `backend/src/services/emailService.js`

#### Option 2: SendGrid
```javascript
const sgMail = require('@sendgrid/mail');
sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY);

await sgMail.send({
  to: email,
  from: 'noreply@taaza.com',
  subject: '🎉 Welcome to Taaza - Your Shop is Now Live!',
  html: emailHTML
});
```

#### Option 3: AWS SES
```javascript
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const ses = new AWS.SES({ region: 'us-east-1' });

await ses.sendEmail({
  Source: 'noreply@taaza.com',
  Destination: { ToAddresses: [email] },
  Message: {
    Subject: { Data: '🎉 Welcome to Taaza - Your Shop is Now Live!' },
    Body: { Html: { Data: emailHTML } }
  }
}).promise();
```
